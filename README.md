# Hospital Readmission Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing patient health records to predict the likelihood of hospital readmissions. By using machine learning algorithms, the goal is to identify patients who are at high risk of being readmitted to the hospital within a certain period after discharge. The project utilizes various patient features such as medical history, condition and procedures, treatment plans, and discharge details to build predictive models.

# Key Features:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: The project uses health records datasets, including medical history, condition and procedures, treatment plans, and discharge summaries. Data cleaning and feature engineering techniques are applied to ensure the data is suitable for analysis.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Neural Networks are employed to predict the likelihood of readmission based on the available patient data.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like Accuracy.Acheived an Accuracy Rate of 85.79%.

Early Intervention: By identifying high-risk patients, healthcare providers can take proactive measures to prevent readmissions, improve patient care, and reduce healthcare costs.

# Project Goals:

To predict which patients are at high risk of readmission using historical health data.
To provide actionable insights for healthcare providers to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions.
To implement effective machine learning techniques for predicting patient health risks.

This project is important for improving healthcare delivery by optimizing care strategies and reducing the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems.
