# Credit Card Fraud detection
This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection model using the RandomForestClassifier from the scikit-learn library.
The model is trained to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

# From dataset we take 30000 transactions, where:
29906 are legitimate transactions (class 0)
94 are fraudulent transactions (class 1)

# Model Performance
The RandomForestClassifier achieved the following results:

Accuracy: 99.89%

Precision: 1.00 (legitimate) | 0.93 (fraudulent)

Recall: 1.00 (legitimate) | 0.76 (fraudulent)

F1-score: 1.00 (legitimate) | 0.83 (fraudulent)
